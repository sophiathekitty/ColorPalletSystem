# ColorPalletSystem
### Notes
requires [SharedVariableSaveSystem](https://github.com/sophiathekitty/SharedVariableSaveSystem)
is still just a first draft. needs a refactoring pass and to setup custom editors and generally make it more user friendly. needs to have pallet previews. and maybe grid and list views for colors with a time slider to move through the gradients to get the colors shown. should be able to add and remove keys in color view. (color = grid, gradient = list)
also i am planning on adding a color gradient shared variable for the save system so i might be able to utilize that for the gradient. that way it would be list view ready.
### Description
setup color pallet profiles with gradients. example: the color of the sky through the day would be a single pallet layer.
